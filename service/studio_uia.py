"""Live per-window read of FT Optix Studio's selected deploy target via UI
Automation.

Windows-ONLY. The read walks the native Qt toolbar of a specific Studio window
(by PID) and returns the Name of the currently-selected deployment target — the
thing an F5 keystroke will actually run. It is a READ-ONLY, background-safe
pre-check (no foreground grab, no cursor, no keystroke); proven on Studio
1.7.1.46 to catch the stale-file divergence where Configuration.xml still claimed
Emulator while the live toolbar was on a hardware panel.

Off Windows (Linux host, CI) and on installs without the `uiautomation` package
or an interactive desktop, every entry point degrades to None. None is the
signal to the caller: "I cannot read the live selection — fall back to the
Configuration.xml advisory." The config-file path in core.py stays the fallback,
so behavior is unchanged wherever this read is unavailable.

    Looks in TWO places, because Studio uses both:

      2. WindowControl children NESTED INSIDE those windows.

    its modals into the main window's scene graph, so they are NOT children of
    the desktop root. Confirmed live on the VM 2026-07-24: clicking Play with a
    hardware panel selected raised a 'Device access' password prompt that sat as
    a child of 'FactoryTalk Optix Studio' and was invisible to a desktop-root
    scan — the top-level-only version of this function returned [] with the
    prompt plainly on screen. Only DIRECT children are scanned; descending
    further starts picking up ordinary in-scene panels.
