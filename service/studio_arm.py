"""Execute a design-time NetLogic ExportMethod inside a specific FT Optix
Studio window, via UI Automation — the mechanism behind arming/stopping the
design-time bridge.

Windows-ONLY. UNLIKE `service/studio_uia.py`, which is deliberately read-only
and background-safe, this module INTERACTS: it takes the foreground,
right-clicks a project-tree row and clicks a menu item. Prior foreground window
and cursor position are restored in a finally block. Keep the two modules
separate so studio_uia's "never grabs focus" contract stays true.

WHY THIS HAS TO EXIST AT ALL
    Studio BUILDS the NetSolution during project load but EXECUTES nothing from
    it — [ModuleInitializer], static ctor and instance ctor all stay cold until
    an explicit right-click -> Execute (the same probes DO fire inside
    FTOptixRuntime, so the negative is real). Studio's CLI has no execute verb
    either (1.7.4.32: open/new/connect/deploy/export only). The GUI gesture is
    the only lever — and the service already runs in session 1, which is the
    only thing that gesture needs.

THREE MEASURED FACTS THIS ENCODES
    1. Right-clicking a FOLDER lists the Execute entries of its NetLogic
       CHILDREN. So the outermost folder is a valid target and the leaf never
       has to be expanded or scrolled to — this removes the whole
       clipped-row/scroll problem (a row scrolled out of the pane keeps its
       scene rect, so clicking it hits whatever is painted there).
    2. Studio windows are NOT always maximised (measured: a half-screen window
       at x=961 w=958), so absolute pane X-bands misfire. Row names also recur
       in other panes. Rather than guess geometry, every candidate row is TRIED
       and the CONTEXT MENU validates it — a Properties-pane label simply does
       not offer "Execute <method>".
    3. Qt/QML draws context menus and modals INTO the window's scene graph, so
       they are children of the main window, never top-level.
    4. A fresh Studio opens with every top-level folder COLLAPSED, and only
       the NetLogic CATEGORY folder lists Execute entries — a plain folder
       above it shows the generic menu. The Project-view Search box (the
       window's only EditControl) is the geometry-free way in: typing the
       leaf's name filters the tree to the leaf WITH its ancestors, all real
       rows with real context menus. {Right} and a double-click do nothing;
       the expander chevron is not a UIA control, but a click two indent
       steps left of the row text toggles it — kept as the fallback.
    5. The Type-view tiles under the tree share the rows' height and x-band,
       so an indent measured from every same-height control reads 6 px
       (1040 -> 1046) instead of 16 and the chevron click lands on the icon.
       Measure only from rows at or above the one being opened.

Off Windows / without `uiautomation` / with no interactive desktop, arm()
returns a structured {"ok": False, "error": ...} rather than raising.
