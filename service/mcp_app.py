        Mechanism: applies `edits` to the project tree, git-commits with

        to produce a runtime-ready bundle, atomically swaps the bundle into

        answers. UpdateSvc / OPC UA is NOT in the path; see docs/architecture.md
        contract for the v0.3 future.

        Args:
          project: project directory name. Omit it — defaults to the bridge's
            served project; only pass it (or discover via optix_list_projects)
            when targeting a project OTHER than the one open in Studio.
          edits: list of edit dicts, UTF-8 plaintext only. THREE MODES —
            prefer the anchored modes; only fall back to full-content for
            new files or full rewrites:

            1. {"path", "find", "replace", "expect_count"?} — ANCHORED
               REPLACE (preferred for changing existing lines/values).
               `find` is a literal string that must occur exactly
               expect_count times (default 1) or the whole batch refuses
               (422 edit_anchor_mismatch) with nothing written. Newlines in
               find/replace auto-match the file's EOL (write "\\n"; CRLF
               files just work).
            2. {"path", "insert_after_anchor", "block"} — ANCHORED INSERT
               (preferred for adding nodes/widgets). `block` is inserted on
               a new line after the line containing the unique anchor.
               Indent the block yourself to match its destination.
            3. {"path", "content"} — FULL REPLACE. Only mode that can
               create a new file. For existing files, prefer modes 1-2:
               re-emitting a whole file risks drifting unrelated lines.

            The batch is atomic: ALL edits resolve against current disk
            state before ANY file is written; one mismatch refuses all.
            One edit per path per batch (later anchored edits would not see
            earlier ones).
          commit_message: git commit message for the audit trail
          run_after_deploy: when True, the runtime is bounced and verified
            via runtime_probe (TCP probe of the test port). When False,
            the swap completes but the runtime is not bounced; verification
            falls back to export_mtime (the swapped tree's mtime advanced
            past deploy start). False is for staged deploys where another
            agent flips the runtime separately.

        Returns the deploy-contract result (docs/architecture.md):
          state ∈ {succeeded, failed},
          studio_exit, verification.{method, confirmed_at, timeout_seconds},
          started_at, completed_at, git_sha, files_written,

        running anywhere on this box — Studio's in-memory model stomps
        file-level edits on save/close (this corrupted a live demo; the
        guard is deliberate). `editor_project_open` (409) means VS / VS Code
        has THIS project open. Remediation in both cases is closing the
        app; there is no override parameter — do not look for one.

        Use this when:
          - the user wants to apply specific edits to an Optix project and
            push the change to the local runtime
          - you have located the target via optix_find / optix_read_file and
            can anchor the change (modes 1-2)

        Do NOT use this when:
          - FactoryTalk Optix Studio is open (close it first — see above)
          - you have not read the target region (optix_find -> ranged
            optix_read_file -> anchored edit is the canonical loop; blind
            full-content writes risk clobbering unrelated changes)
          - the edit is large or speculative; review first, then anchor
          - you only want to stage a build (use optix_studio_export — it
            produces the same staging tree without touching the live runtime)

        Verify-half tip: the returned verification.method is runtime_probe

        cheap way to learn a project's structure instead of walking it with
        repeated optix_describe_node.

        Depth is AUTOMATIC by what you point it at: a FOLDER (or no path) gives
        orientation ("overview") — folders expand, each component is one line
        with a "(+N inside)" count, variables fold into "(N vars)". A COMPONENT
        path (e.g. "UI/MainWindow") gives the full subtree ("detail" — every
        node kind, at the default depth 6; NOT necessarily fully expanded).
        Pass depth= to force a detail walk at that depth. Pointers and
        bindings are DEREFERENCED inline ("Panel (NodePointer -> UI/Screens/
        ScreenA)") — a detail map of a screen doubles as its wiring audit.
        Placeholder collections render as "Name {ElementType}"; truncation is
        always marked "... +N more".

        match="Pump*" turns the call into a LIVE-MODEL SEARCH (name or type,
        case-insensitive) returning matching full paths, ready to pass to any
        tool. MATCHING IS EXACT unless you use * wildcards: match="Grid" only
        finds nodes NAMED/TYPED exactly "Grid" — a node named GridLayout1 needs
        match="Grid*" or match="*Grid*". When hunting for something, default to
        "*substring*"; a bare word silently returns 0 hits for partial names
        (two independent field agents have mis-assumed substring semantics).
        Use this instead of optix_find for live-model lookups (optix_find greps
        FILES and is refused while Studio is open).

        IMPORTANT: the map shows MATERIALIZED nodes only. A property a type
        offers but that was never set does NOT appear — its absence here never
        means you can't set it (optix_bridge_set_property materializes on
        write). Consult optix_describe_type for what a type accepts.

        format="outline" (default) returns readable indented text with a
        header line — for HUMAN/model eyes. Programmatic callers should use
        format="json" (structured tree + mode/truncated fields; never parse
        the outline header). ids=true adds NodeIds (rarely needed — tools

        (active_target_not_emulator) instead of pressing F5 — ask the user to
        switch the dropdown; the service never changes it. After launch the

        THE SHIP STEP — deliberate, not the everyday verify. For iteration, use
        optix_run_emulator + optix_cdp_screenshot (much faster, no transfer);
        deploy AFTER the emulator preview confirms the change. It WORKS WITH
        FACTORYTALK OPTIX STUDIO OPEN: the `deploy` verb spawns its
        OWN short-lived Studio to build+transfer the project; your interactive Studio
        AND the design-time bridge stay up the whole time, so you never close
        anything between iterations. (Verified: deploys succeed with Studio open and
        the bridge armed; the bridge survives every deploy.)

        Contrast with optix_deploy, the export path, which REFUSES while Studio is
        open (409 studio_open). So: Studio open + bridge armed -> optix_deploy_updatesvc.

        Mechanism: runs the Studio `deploy` verb, which opens the SAVED project from
        disk, builds it, and transfers it to the UpdateSvc at the configured deploy
        IP (set OPTIX_DEPLOY_IP / OPTIX_DEPLOY_USERNAME / OPTIX_DEPLOY_THUMBPRINT, and
        OPTIX_STUDIO_DEPLOYMENT_PASSWORD in the env). With run_after=True and a
        logged-in deploy user, the verb starts the runtime itself. It SAVES the
        project first by default (save_first) — the deploy reads disk, so unsaved
        bridge/Studio edits would otherwise not ship. Returns {deployed, saved, ip_address, username,
        run_after_deploy, source_transfer_disabled, build_race_warning, returncode,
        stdout_tail}.

        NOTE: when Studio is open the result carries a `build_race_warning`. It is
        ADVISORY ONLY — `deployed` is still true and the change is live. It does NOT
        mean you must close Studio; it just flags that the open Studio's NetSolution
        build could race the verb's build (the verb retries and wins). Do not treat
        it as a refusal or a reason to close Studio.

        disable_source_transfer: skip sending the source .optix tree to the target
        (built runtime only — faster; the default, configurable via
        OPTIX_DEPLOY_KEEP_SOURCE). Pass False to force the source onto the target

        browser (Cowork's native visualize, a Mac/host browser, etc.). *** It drives
        the local chrome-cdp on the SAME box as the runtime (loopback), so it works
        without any external browser and without exposing the runtime on the network.

        You do NOT need to know or pass the runtime URL: called with no navigate_url
        it AUTO-navigates to the local runtime and captures it (skipping the reload if
        the tab is already there, so a click→re-screenshot keeps its state). Pass an
        explicit navigate_url only to point somewhere else; pass navigate_url="" to
        screenshot the current tab as-is.

        CDP Page.captureScreenshot — no tab plumbing. This tool ALWAYS writes the JPEG
        to a file and returns its `path`; by default **read the file back with your
        file tool.** It does NOT put base64 in the JSON: a large b64 string makes some
        hosts try to *render* it inline (Cowork's "visualize"), which can hang for a
        long time on a sandboxed or headless host (verified: file-path runs are fast,
        b64-in-JSON runs stall). **Prefer passing your own `save_path`** in your
        session/output directory so your file tool can definitely read it; omit it and
        the tool picks a temp path.

        `return_image=true` additionally returns the capture as TYPED MCP image
        content (not b64-in-JSON) so the model sees it in the same turn with no file
        round-trip. Field-verified on Cowork (2026-07-22): typed image content
        renders cleanly — the stall was specific to b64-in-JSON. PREFER
        return_image=true when your host's file tool cannot reach the service's
        filesystem (Cowork's sandboxed bash); combine with region= to keep the
        payload small.

        full frame (e.g. zooming a vision model in on one widget, or shrinking the
        image before OCR). Coordinate convention: if ALL FOUR values are <= 1.0 they
        are normalized fractions of the viewport (0.5 = mid-screen); if ANY value is
        > 1 the whole list is absolute pixels. A malformed region (wrong length,
        negative, zero width/height, or x/y outside the frame) returns
        state='failed', error='bad_region' rather than raising. The result's
        `region` field echoes back the resolved absolute-pixel [x, y, w, h] (or null

        `path` is directly usable as `routes_path` for optix_cdp_navigate /

        `region` uses the shared convention: all four values <= 1.0 are
        normalized viewport fractions, any value > 1 is absolute pixels. An
        unknown `mode` returns a structured error naming the valid modes rather
        than raising.

        OCR can't resolve SMALL controls: full-frame tesseract renders small
        button labels as garbage, so ocr/read_text/find_text legitimately fail
        on them (find_text returns found:false — not an error). For small
        controls, drive them by coordinates + a `screenshot` (vision) read-back
        rather than find_text; reserve find_text for larger/clearer labels.

        Use this when:
          - reading anything BACK from the live canvas — a screenshot to verify
            a deploy, an OCR check that a label says X, locating a control, or a
            visual-regression diff
          - you want a single read tool instead of remembering five CDP names

        Consolidates optix_cdp_click / _fill / _type / _key / _navigate; the
        per-action tools remain as deprecated aliases (FTXMCP_LEGACY_TOOLS).

        action:
          - "click" — trusted CDP mouse click at (`x`, `y`) on the canvas (the
            reliable path Optix's canvas needs). Requires `x`, `y`.
          - "fill" — set a field in ONE call: click (`x`, `y`) -> (select-all)
            -> type `text` -> commit with `submit` (default Enter; None types
            without committing). THE way to set a TextBox/SpinBox. Requires
            `x`, `y`, `text`.
          - "type" — insert `text` into the already-focused field (no click, no
            commit). Requires `text`.
          - "key" — press one named `key` (Enter/Escape/Tab/Backspace/Delete/
            Arrow*) — the commit step for edits. Requires `key`.
          - "navigate" — replay a banked click `route` from `routes_path`
            (zero-screenshot navigation). Requires `route`, `routes_path`;
            honors `expect`.

        Coordinates use the shared convention (values <= 1.0 = normalized
        viewport fractions, > 1 = absolute pixels). An unknown `action`, or a
        required param missing for the chosen action, returns a structured error
        rather than raising.

        VERIFY, don't trust the return: state="succeeded" means the CDP event was
        DISPATCHED, not that anything changed — a click at the wrong coordinate
        still returns succeeded. Always follow a click/fill with a read-back
        (optix_observe screenshot/ocr, or optix_describe_node) and confirm the
        value actually moved before proceeding.

          - you need to CHANGE the runtime — press a button, set a field value,
            commit an edit, or jump to a banked screen

        """Apply a BATCH of live-model authoring ops, validated as a whole first.

        Each op is a dict with an `op` field naming the verb plus that verb's
        fields, e.g.
            [{"op": "create_widget", "screen": "UI/MainWindow",
              "name": "Gauge1", "widget_type": "Rectangle"},
             {"op": "set_property", "path": "UI/MainWindow/Gauge1",
              "name": "Width", "value": "120"}]

        Valid ops: set_property, bind, create_widget, create_variable,
        create_folder, create_object, create_type, create_alias, delete, move,
        reorder, wire_event, attach_expression, add_translation.

        WHY BATCH: the bridge validates the ENTIRE list before anything is
        written, against a hypothetical model that accumulates this batch's own
        creates and deletes. So "create a node then set a property on it"
        validates clean, while the reverse order is caught up front with the
        offending `op_index` — instead of half-applying and leaving you to work
        out what landed. Ordering mistakes, misspelled properties, bad values,
        deleting a node a later op still touches, and duplicate creates are all
        refused before the first write.

        You normally call this ONCE and let it apply: it validates the whole
        batch FIRST and applies nothing if validation fails (state="validated"
        with the errors), so a separate dry_run pass is NOT needed to be safe.
        Re-sending a large op list twice (dry_run then apply) is the single most
        wasteful thing you can do here — you regenerate the whole payload for no
        added safety. Reserve `dry_run=True` (validate, apply NOTHING) for a
        genuinely risky batch you want to inspect before committing. `strict=True`
        promotes lint warnings (e.g. creating over a node that already exists)
        into errors.

        SIZE: batch ONE component's related ops — a widget plus its properties
        plus its binding/expression — NOT a whole screen. A 100-op mega-batch
        takes minutes to generate and apply as one blocking call and gambles the
        whole screen on a single partial-failure point; component-sized batches
        keep generation fast, failures local, and progress visible.

        NOT ATOMIC, and the result says so. Studio's live model has no
        transaction to roll back to, so if op N fails at apply time, ops 0..N-1
        stay applied: you get state="partial", `applied` counting what landed,
        and `failed_op`. Read `applied` — never assume a failure means nothing
        happened. Validation up front is what makes that rare, not impossible.

        Returns {state, applied, op_count, report, dry_run} where state is
        validated | succeeded | partial.

        Use this when:
          - you have several related edits for ONE component (a widget plus its
            properties plus a binding) — batch them so they validate and land
            together

        Do NOT use this when:
          - you have ONE edit — the per-noun tool (optix_bridge_set_property,
            optix_bridge_create_widget, ...) is simpler
          - Studio is closed or the bridge is down (live authoring needs both)
          - the bridge predates U16 — validate_ops returns bridge_unavailable
